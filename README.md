# KUtils

KUtils is a simple header-only library for kernelspace usage. It allows for some basic string manipulation and simple IO functions.

This is mostly just some functions that I found I use a lot in my own project which may be beneficial to you, as it's mostly pretty repetitive.

Read the documentation in [usage.md](https://github.com/kutils/blob/main/usage.md) on how to use the functions.

You may notice that a lot of these function names do not match up with the C standard library. *They are not supposed to.* Please do not complain about that because I will ignore you.

Don't expect this to be perfect. Again, it's mostly some simple functions I created when I happened to need them, and more will be added as I require them. It's not so much a standalone project, rather than some nice utilities leftover from my main project.

Feel free to make a pull request or create an issue if there's anything you want to change.
